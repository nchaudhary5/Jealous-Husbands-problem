# Jealous-Husbands-problem

(In Java programming language)

I am writing a program that finds a solution to the "Jealous Husband Problem". 
I am using Depth-First-Search algorithm to find a solution to the "Jealous Husband problem.

The program should search through the state space searching for a solution. 
If a solution is found, it should indicate the actions (in order) to get everyone across safely. 
If no solution is possible, then the program should indicate no solution was found.

For example, one action in the solution output could be:     Wife from shore a to shore b.
Another action could be something like:      Husband and Wife from shore b to shore a.
